# C# unit testing
This project is a demo of unit testing in a simple windows form application written in C#.

## How to create new unit tests?
Navigate to the "testOperations.cs" in the CalculatorTesting project under solution explorer, then write the unit test you like to try. Don't forget the [TestMethod] decorator for each test you are writing.

## How to run unit tests?
Under the Test tab in Visual Studio, click on Test Explorer (or simply press Ctrl + E then T). The new displayed window contains all the tests of the solution. You can run single test by selecting one and clicking on "Run", or run all the tests by clicking "Run All Tests In View" (this method takes less time in case you want to run more than one test).
